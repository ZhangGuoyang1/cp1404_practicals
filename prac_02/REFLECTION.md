# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched about 85% of the lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually stay in the dormitory at night and arrange time to watch videos for about 1 hour each time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I finish most of my homework on time, and if I have any problems, I will check the information or ask my classmates in time. I will continue to do this.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to reduce procrastination and don't wait until the deadline to start the task.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

In the practical process, sometimes I don't test the code carefully after writing it. I will change it to do several tests after writing it to ensure that the results are correct.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

In the practical session, I can quickly understand the requirements of the topic and write the code that can basically run, which I think I did a good job.
