# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates are usually not accurate at the beginning, and I often underestimate 
the difficulty of the task or ignore some detailed steps. Many times, 
I thought I could complete the task in 10 minutes, but it turned out to take 20 to 30 minutes.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

With more practice, I have a clearer understanding of the complexity of the task, 
and the estimate has gradually become more reasonable.

Especially after being familiar with Python's file operations, function design and testing, 
I can more accurately predict which parts will take time and which parts are simple.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned:

It is very important to think about the task structure before writing code.

Most of the time, it is not writing code, but debugging and understanding problems.

Estimates can help me allocate my study time and make me more efficient.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that others can often see the details that I ignore, such as unclear naming, 
lack of annotations, structures that can be improved, etc.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Review other people's code allows me to understand the coding style, logical conciseness and SRP (single responsibility) more clearly.

When I pointed out other people's problems, I also realized that I often had similar problems.

At the same time, seeing excellent code can also help me learn how to write better.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/DingZuotian/CP1404/pull/2/files]()

### Explanation

In this review, the suggestions I give are specific and executable, such as improving variable naming, 
reducing duplicate code and applying function decomposition.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/DingZuotian/CP1404/pull/2/files]()

### Explanation

The highlight of this review is that I not only pointed out the problem, 
but also gave example solutions and encouraged the other party to optimize the logical structure.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Provide more automated tests so that students can verify the code quality by themselves.

Add more real cases in the API and Flask section to make the application scenario clearer.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Complete all prac on time and maintain a stable progress

When writing code, try to keep the structure clear and follow the SRP principle.

Use test (assert, doctest) to help improve code quality
