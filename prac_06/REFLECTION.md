# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started planning my work before coding, breaking tasks into smaller steps instead of jumping straight 
into writing code. I now spend more time reading the instructions carefully and testing my code incrementally 
to avoid large mistakes later.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my time better and start practicals earlier each week. Sometimes I leave them too close 
to the deadline, which creates unnecessary pressure. I also want to review feedback from code reviews more deeply 
to improve my coding habits.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m consistent in completing all practicals and following the submission process properly. I’ve also been writing 
cleaner, more readable code with comments and meaningful variable names, which makes debugging and reviewing much 
easier.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying too much on trial and error when solving problems. Instead, I should use more deliberate 
debugging and better understand the logic before coding. I also want to avoid rushing through testing just to get a 
“working” result.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

No suggestions for now. I’m happy with how the subject is going.
